abstract = {Estimates of the age and growth of round-tail chub Gila robusta were made by analyzing thin cross sections of sagittal otoliths from 280 specimens collected in the upper Verde River, Arizona, from January 1997 to December 1999. Marginal increment analysis indicated that a single annulus completed formation between January and May. The use of otoliths to age round-tail chub was further validated using otoliths of knownage, hatchery-reared fish for which (upon examination) the number of annuli agreed 100{\%} of the time with the true age of the fish. In addition, daily increments were observed on sagittal otoliths of age-0 roundtail chub and, when counted, agreed with the true age of fish 70{\%} of the time: daily ring counts were within 1 and 2 d of the true age 80{\%} and 90{\%} of the time, respectively. Ages assigned to wild-caught fish by three independent readers resulted in a coefficient of variation (100 X SD/ mean) of 8.2. Ages of roundtail chub varied from I to 7, the largest fish being a 427-mm total length (TL), 836-g total weight (TW). age-7 female. The largest m ale was 413 turn TL, 629 g TW, and age 6. The growth of age-1-7 roundtail chub (both sexes combined) was greatest during the first year and was best described by the equation L-t = 499.30 [1 - e(-0.23(t-0.147))], where L-t is length at time t.},

abstract = {We evaluated eye lenses as potential recorders of stable isotope histories in fish because they consist of metabolically inert optical proteins that are deposited in successive, concentric circles (laminae) much like otolith circuli and tree rings. We conducted four different tests on lenses from red snapper, red grouper, gag, and white grunt. The first test was a low-resolution screening of multiple individuals (4-5 radial groups of laminae per lens, all species except white grunt). Along the radial axis, all individuals exhibited substantial isotopic variability. Red snapper individuals separated into two groups based on $\delta$15N and gag separated into two groups based on $\delta$31C. Two gag with the greatest variation were chosen for high-resolution temporal analysis using individual laminae from their second eye lenses. The first-order patterns from the high-resolution analysis generally mimicked patterns from the low-resolution screening of grouped laminae, yet the high-resolution plots revealed early-life details that were not apparent in the low-resolution screenings. For the third test, left-versus right-eye variation was compared using high-resolution methods. White grunt left- and right-eye radial isotopic patterns were almost identical for both $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N, suggesting the variations observed among individual fish were not artifacts. The final test evaluated intra-laminar variation; multiple samples were analyzed from different parts of the same lamina. Seven laminae from three individuals of two species were analyzed in this manner; variations among laminae were found to be much higher than variations within laminae. However, nominal intra-laminar variations were comparable to nominal differences between left and right lenses, suggesting intra-laminar variation established measurement precision. Eye lens isotopes appear to be useful for reconstructing the isotopic histories of individual fish; these histories can be compared with spatially-derived isoscapes to reconstruct individual histories for site fidelity, movement and trophic position.},
